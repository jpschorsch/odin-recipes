        <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
        <p>This chocolate chip cookie recipe was found online so that I would have something to fill this project
            out with. I think it might be the one that my wife makes, but I am not sure. It is pretty hard
            to mess up chocolate chip cookies though.
